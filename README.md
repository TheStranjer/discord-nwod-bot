# Discord nWoD / CofD bot

Lady Luck is a bot that rolls ten sided dice and counts successes by the New World of Darkness / Chronicles of Darkness rules: 8, 9, and 10 is a "success" while 10s reroll. Optionally 9s or 8s can reroll, or you can opt for no rerolls.

Lady Luck uses random.org's random numbers, which means it's authentically random, or as close to that as we're going to get in computing.
